# Renewable Energy Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project is a **Streamlit** portfolio where you will be able to find informations about me, an uber data analyzing project, and mainly the Renewable Energy Data Analysis Project.
This project provides an interactive data visualization dashboard using **Streamlit** to explore and analyze the production of various types of renewable energy in different regions of France. It allows users to filter data based on specific years, energy types, and geographical regions, helping to identify trends in renewable energy production over time.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following types of renewable energy production:

- Hydroelectric
- Solar
- Wind
- Biomass
- Renewable Gas

The data is divided by region and includes yearly production figures for different types of energy, helping analyze the energy landscape across France.

## Why Analyze This Dataset?

The global shift toward renewable energy makes it crucial to understand production trends and regional differences. By analyzing this dataset, we can:

1. **Track renewable energy growth**: Compare the production trends of different renewable energy sources over time.
2. **Evaluate regional differences**: Discover which regions in France contribute the most to renewable energy production.
3. **Support decision-making**: Identify growth areas and growing energies.

## How to Launch the Project

### Requirements

If you download directly the project, you need to be sure to have  the requirements :

1. **Python 3.7+** must be installed on your machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:

### The project uses the following key libraries:

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib & plotly: For data visualization.
- Streamlit: To create the interactive dashboard.

## Navigating the Project
### The dashboard consists of the following main sections:

1. Understanding the Dataset: Provides an overview of the dataset.
2. Handling data problems: Looking for the errors in the dataset and how to correct them.
3. Analysis by Energy Type: Allows users to select a specific energy type (e.g., solar, wind) and see the production trend over time.
4. Regional Insights: Explore the production of renewable energy across different regions of France and identify which regions contribute the most.
5. Map Visualization: Interactive map showing the production of renewable energy across France. Users can select specific years and energy types.

### Interactive Features:
- Filters: Users can filter the data by year, energy type, and region.
- Map Visualization: Displays an interactive map where each region is highlighted based on energy production.
- Time-Based Analysis: View the evolution of energy production over time using animated charts and histograms.
